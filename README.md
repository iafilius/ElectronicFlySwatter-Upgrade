# ElectronicFlySwatter-Upgrade
Upgrade a common electrical flyswatter bat to get more punch

# Introduction

The common electronic flyswatter bat might nog give enough punch to your needs, eg you might be able to get it effective on wasps and bigger flying insects (like horse flies).

# Issues with non modified Electronic Flyswatters

    * Wasps are not the impressed with your un-modified fly swatter, and keep coming
    * Huge stinging flies (like horse flies) are not impressed and keep coming also.

# Solution

    * Upgrade the fly swatter to get more punch, and make sure bigger insects got the message, and get get killed, or do no longer return when hit once.

# Goals 

* higher output voltage
* higher capacity on discharge
* fast charge to ready output
* high output current for continues "frying"
* remove the high pitched sound, not warning the suspects

# Commonly proposed modifications

* Remove the parallel discharge resistor
* add bigger capacitor

# Not seen mentioned before

* Use Alkaline batteries, and not Zink-Chloride
    * Alkaline has much lower internal resistance
     !["Undesired Zink Cloride batteries"](pictures/IMG_9744.JPG "IMG_9744.JPG")
* Replace thin power (battery) wires by thick onces
    * remove unneeded extra resistance
    !["Thicker power wires"](pictures/IMG_9747.JPG "IMG_9747.JPG")
* shorten the power wires
    * remove extra resistance
* [Untested] replace switching transistor with lower Vsat
    * leave a higher effective voltage on switching transformer
* [Untested] use a boost convertor to get a little higher voltage (5V)
    * this might impact static current settings, and might need output diode and capacitor upgraded to a higher voltage.

# Simple tests

Issue: Most Voltage meaters won't go over 1000V DC, you possible ruin your meter when trying.

Primitive but easy to execute tests:
    * test single discharge with a isolated screwdriver to notice possible improved "punch"
    * test repeated discharge with a isolated scredriver, and leave a smal air gab, and notice imporivemd in speed is discharges again.

# Words of warning

    * These devices are not for children
    * Removing the discharge reistor may surprise you or someone else sooner or later
    * Proposed modification may void warrenty
    * Proposed changes might get them no longer certified
    * Mark your fly swatter, for example with red tape, so you are remembered what has been executed on the device.
